A modern, cross-platform desktop application for managing my ESP devices. Built with Tauri, React, and TypeScript, this app provides an easy and modern interface for controlling and organizing my devices and a way to share the device configuration with others.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Currently, the app only supports switches running a custom firmware. However, the system is designed to be easily extensible for other device types in the future.
> - The custom firmware is not yet uploaded‚Äîplease check the [TODO section](TODO.md) for updates.

## üîß Configuration

### Database

The app uses SQLite with Drizzle ORM. Database migrations are handled automatically through Drizzle Kit but, currently, needs to be pasted on the Rust side.

Originally, at least on desktop, the `migrate()` function handle the migrations automatically and tauri was in charge of add the `migrations/` folder to the bundle but for some [bug](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/8911) the android build is unable to access to the bundled resources.

The app uses SQLite as its local database, managed through Drizzle ORM for type-safe operations. Database migrations are generated automatically using Drizzle Kit. However, due to current platform limitations, these migration strings (`src-tauri/migrations/`) must be manually copied to the Rust backend (`src-tauri/src/migrations.rs`).

On desktop platforms, the `migrate()` function can automatically apply migrations, with Tauri bundling the `migrations/` folder as part of the application. However, due to a [known issue](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/8911), the Android build cannot access bundled resources, so migrations must be handled manually.

## Data & Actions Layer ("API Layer")

The app implements a structured "API layer" inspired by [this architecture](https://profy.dev/article/react-architecture-api-layer), organized as a **Data-Actions layer**. This approach separates concerns and provides a clean interface for the React app to interact with persistent data, similar to "Server Actions" in Next.js.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build fails with Tauri errors:**

- Ensure Rust is properly installed and up to date
- Check that all Tauri dependencies are installed
- Run `cargo clean` and try building again

**Database migration issues:**

- Run `pnpm migrate` to generate new migrations
- Copy the migration string into `src-tauri/src/migrations.rs` if it is necessary
- Check that the database file is writable

**Development frontend issues:**

- Clear node_modules and reinstall dependencies
- Ensure all prerequisites are properly installed
